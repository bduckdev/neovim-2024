## TODO

- Decide on using fugitive or lazygit for git management

- Consider [Trouble.nvim](https://github.com/folke/trouble.nvim) for lsp info

- Rewrite live-server commands to use npm tools

- add all this new stuff to my [dotfiles](https://github.com/bduckdev/.dotfiles)

- add plugin links to readme.md

### Add Plugins

- [UndoTree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree)

- [Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon/tree/harpoon2) (fast file switching)

- Git Integration (need to make up my mind on this one)
